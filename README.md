# Robokart-Engine

The Robokart Engine is a set of ROS based Software tools that bridge the gap between robotics and game development.
It offers a camera based system which gives developers access to all the information a game engine would normally provide.

This enables the user to programm games that will be played using real life objects and robotics.

## Tutorials
The [Wiki](https://github.com/liquidcronos/Robokart-Engine/wiki) offers a variety of tutorials that not only show how to get started with the engine but also achieve common tasks such as writting a player class or defining NPCs which interact with the world.
