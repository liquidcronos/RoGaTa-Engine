# Robokart-Engine

The Robokart Engine is a set of ROS based Software tools that bridge the gap between robotics and game development.
It offers a camera based system which gives developers access to all the information a game engine would normally provide.

This enables the user to programm games that will be played using real life objects and robotics.
