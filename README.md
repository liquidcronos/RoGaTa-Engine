# Robokart-Engine

The Robokart Engine is a set of ROS based Software tools that bridge the gap between robotics and game development.
It offers a camera based system which gives developers access to all the information a game engine would normally provide.

This enables the user to programm games that will be played using real life objects and robotics.

## Tutorials
The [Wiki](https://github.com/liquidcronos/Robokart-Engine/wiki) offers a variety of tutorials that not only show how to get started with the engine but also achieve common tasks such as writting a player class or defining NPCs which interact with the world.


## Getting Started
* Install [ROS Melodic](http://wiki.ros.org/melodic)
* Setup ROS on your Robots (the tutorials will use the [turtlebot burger](https://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/platform/turtlebot3/quick-start/)
* Install [OpenCV-Python](https://docs.opencv.org/master/da/df6/tutorial_py_table_of_contents_setup.html)
* Follow the [Setup Tutorial](https://github.com/liquidcronos/Robokart-Engine/wiki/Set-Up-Robokart-Enviroment) in the Wiki
